// MinimizeToTray
//
// A couple of routines to show how to make it produce a custom caption
// animation to make it look like we are minimizing to and maximizing 
// from the system tray
//
// These routines are public domain, but it would be nice if you dropped
// me a line if you use them!
//
// 1.0 29.06.2000 Initial version
// 1.1 01.07.2000 The window retains it's place in the Z-order of windows
//     when minimized/hidden. This means that when restored/shown, it doen't
//     always appear as the foreground window unless we call SetForegroundWindow

  // on the 3rd party shell's Shell_TrayWnd doing the same, in fact, we can't
  // rely on it being any size. The best we can do is just blindly use the
  // window rect, perhaps limiting the width and height to, say 150 square.
